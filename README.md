Access-Kit is a Dashboard where you can check your website's WCAG compliance. It breaks down the possible areas of issue in your front-end code and shows you the error associated with the code segment. It is currently deployed on Vercel at domain https://access-report-accesskit-co.vercel.app/ if you want to check it out.
